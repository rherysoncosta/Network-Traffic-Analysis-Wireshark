# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

üîç **Project:** Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark for Cybersecurity Investigation  
üìÇ **Type:** Hands-on Lab & Packet Capture (PCAP) Analysis  
üéØ **Skills Demonstrated:** Network Protocol Analysis, Packet Filtering, TCP/IP, DNS, Security Monitoring

---

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed detailed network traffic analysis using Wireshark, a leading protocol analyzer tool. The objective was to analyze packet captures (PCAP files) to identify communication patterns, protocols, and payload data between client and server during web browsing activities.

---

## What I Did

- Opened and explored network capture files using Wireshark‚Äôs GUI  
- Applied display filters to isolate specific IP addresses, protocols, and MAC addresses  
- Inspected DNS traffic to analyze domain name resolutions  
- Analyzed TCP packets to identify HTTP traffic and searched for specific payload data (e.g., curl commands)  
- Interpreted protocol headers and flags at multiple layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP) for deep packet inspection

## Tools & Technologies

- Wireshark (GUI-based packet analyzer)  
- PCAP files (Packet capture data format)  
- Protocol knowledge: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, ICMP

---

## Why This Matters

Network traffic analysis is a fundamental skill in cybersecurity for monitoring, detecting, and investigating potential threats or anomalies in communications. Mastery of Wireshark and protocol analysis supports incident response and forensic investigations.
